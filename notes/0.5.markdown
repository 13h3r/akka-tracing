New features:

* Akka HTTP support
* Spray client support
* automatic tracing context propagation for messages serialized by Akka facilities
* support for custom context propagation via tracing metadata API calls
* `trace.flush` call forcing the extension to submit a span
* `trace.sampleClient` call to initiate traces from client side

Improvements:

* greatly improved test coverage
* better interoperability with [Brave](https://github.com/openzipkin/brave)
* span processing pipeline implementation now uses akka-stream underneath
* backpressure implementation for thrift transport
* black lists for automatically tracked HTTP headers
* mutable fields were removed from `TracingSupport`
* spray integration: reject requests with broken tracing headers

API changes:

* `child.asChildOf(parent)` was deprecated, use `trace.createChild(parent, child)` instead
* `trace.finish` was deprecated, use `trace.record(ts, TracingAnnotations.ServerSend)` instead
