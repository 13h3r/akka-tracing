New features:

* Play framework support (and [activator template](http://typesafe.com/activator/template/activator-play-tracing) to demonstrate it);
* tracing flags support;
* `akka.pattern.ask` wrapper to simplify ask tracing;
* collector unavailability handling preventing excessive memory usage.

Improvements:

* reusable thrift transport to reduce GC overhead;
* better interoperation with spray-json formats;
* improved test coverage;
* improved error handling and reporting;
* now extension doesn't produce any (internal messaging) overhead if disabled;
* improved automated http request annotating in Play and Spray integration modules;
* [bug fixes](https://github.com/levkhomich/akka-tracing/issues?labels=bug&milestone=4&page=1&state=closed).

API changes:

* new method `trace.forcedSample` which allows to sample message independently of sampling rate;
* new method `trace.finish(msg)` which can be used to explicitly finish trace (for example, in cases when you have no response to be marked by `.asResponseTo`);
* `trace.setSampleRate` was removed, you still can use config to set sample rate;
* `unmarshallerWithTracingSupport` was removed from Spray integration module;
* `trace.sample(msg, service, spanName)` was deprecated, use `trace.sample(msg, service)` and override `msg.spanName` instead.
